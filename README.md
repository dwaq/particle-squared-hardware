# Particle Squared - Bare Bones

This is a forked version of [Jared Wolff's Particle Squared Hardware](https://bitbucket.org/circuitdojo/particle-squared-hardware). For more information on that board, [visit his website](https://www.jaredwolff.com/particle-squared-air-quality-sensor/). To support him and his work, you can  [order his sensors from here](https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/particle-squared/).

Particle^2 (pronounced Particle Squared) is a circuit board that helps you monitor the air quality around you. I call my fork of the project "Bare Bones" because I removed the air particulate sensor. It can still monitor humidity, temperature, eCO2 and TVOCs.

I also made some minor changes to the project to suit my goals.
